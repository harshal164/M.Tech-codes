Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra. Invented by Lester S. Hill in 1929, it was the first polygraphic cipher in which it was practical (though barely) to operate on more than three symbols at once.

 requires the user to have an elementary understanding of matrices. It also make use of Modulo Arithmetic. because of this, the cipher has a significantly more mathematical nature than some of the others.

Encryption:


To encrypt a message using the Hill Cipher we must first turn our keyword into a key matrix (a 2 x 2 matrix for working with digraphs, a 3 x 3 matrix for working with trigraphs, etc). We also turn the plaintext into digraphs (or trigraphs) and each of these into a column vector. We then perform matrix multiplication modulo the length of the alphabet (i.e. 26) on each vector. These vectors are then converted back into letters to produce the ciphertext.

the first step is to turn the keyword into a matrix. 

 If the keyword was longer than the 4 letters needed, we would only take the first 4 letters, and if it was shorter, we would fill it up with the alphabet in order 

With the keyword in a matrix, we need to convert this into a key matrix. We do this by converting each letter into a number by its position in the alphabet (starting at 0). So, A = 0, B = 1, C= 2, D = 3, etc.

We now split the plaintext into digraphs, and write these as column vectors. That is, in the first column vector we write the first plaintext letter at the top, and the second letter at the bottom. Then we move to the next column vector, where the third plaintext letter goes at the top, and the fourth at the bottom. This continues for the whole plaintext.
